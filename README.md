## Overview

**AURA (Autonomous Understanding and Reflective Agent)** is a HER-inspired, emotionally intelligent **multi-agent system** for emotional wellness. AURA coordinates specialized agents to listen, understand, and respond to users with empathetic, metaphor-rich language while curating mood-aligned content and maintaining long-term context.

Built for **Luddy Hackathon — Case 4**, AURA is locally hosted and emphasizes **privacy**, **transparency**, and **reliability**.

## Problem Statement

Emotional support is often delayed or inaccessible. **AURA** acts as a digital companion that provides timely, thoughtful responses so users feel **heard, supported, and understood**. It blends emotional intelligence with AI to provide **reflections, curated content,** and **calming interactions**.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

While AURA does **not** directly use Microsoft’s AutoGen, it mirrors key principles:

- **Autonomous Agents:** Independent behaviors and decision logic  
- **Message-Passing Protocol:** Centralized, extensible communication handler  
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Custom layer for context sharing and task coordination across agents

---

## System Architecture

AURA is an orchestrated symphony of intelligent agents collaborating over a shared protocol and state.
